#Craftitizer

Craftitizer is an in-development, modular utility for creating Minecraft server installations based on predefined configuration files.
It will have full support for the Mojang "official" server software, CraftBukkit/Spigot server software, indirect support for FTB or other modded
server softwares to some extent.

It uses HOCON config files so that it's very easy to work with by hand.
