#Craftitizer

Craftitizer is an in-development, modular utility for creating Minecraft server installations based on predefined configuration files.
It will have full support for the Mojang "official" server software, CraftBukkit/Spigot server software, indirect support for FTB or other modded
server softwares to some extent.

It uses Python-based package configuration systems so it is very easy to create very flexible server configurations
